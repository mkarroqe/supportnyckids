# Support NYC Kids !
landing page to connect local volunteer tutors with kids in need

## Problem
On Thursday, November 19th, New York City's entire public school system was shut down once again. Students, parents, and teachers have struggled since March to adjust to remote learning, and local government has done nothing to support improving the experience. Many low income students have unreliable internet connections, and others have too much going on in their homes to focus when class is in session. The class divide is only getting larger in the era of COVID, as students from wealthier backgrounds are supported with high speed internet and private tutors, while their lower-income counterparts get left behind.

## Call to Action
College students, professionals in industry-- please consider donating an hour of your time to help local kids with homework. I'll do my best to connect you to students in need.
